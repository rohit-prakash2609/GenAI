This Jupyter Notebook is designed as an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization pipeline for structured datasets, serving as a foundational step in generative AI workflows involving tabular data.

ðŸ“Œ Key Steps in the Notebook
Importing Libraries
Utilizes popular Python packages like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

Data Upload and Loading
Prompts for uploading a CSV file (assumes a file like tips.csv) and loads it into a DataFrame.

Descriptive Statistics
Calculates and displays descriptive statistics including Mean, Std Dev, Min, Median, and Max for numeric columns.

Missing Value Detection
Displays the count of missing values in each column.

Outlier Detection
Identifies outliers based on the 15th and 90th percentile thresholds for each numeric column.

Univariate Analysis

Histograms for numerical features with KDE overlays.

Count plots for categorical variables.

Bivariate Analysis

Correlation heatmap for numerical variables.

Box plots showing tip distribution across different categories.

ðŸŽ¯ Use Case
While the notebook itself is not directly implementing a generative model, it plays a crucial role in preparing clean and meaningful insights from data â€” a critical first step before training any generative AI system (e.g., synthetic tabular data generation, feature engineering for models like CTGAN, etc.).
